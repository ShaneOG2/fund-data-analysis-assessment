# Fundamentals of Data Analysis

This repository contains my work for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Module at ATU as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analytics). 

# Overview

This repository contains a `Practicals` folder which has two parts:

1. `Regular Tasks`
2. `Normal Distribuion Notebook.ipynb`

The `Regular Tasks` contains 5 Jupyter Notebooks, each containing exercises from each topic we explored over the course of the module. 

- `1-Information.ipynb`
- `2-Randomness.ipynb`
- `3-Bias.ipynb`
- `4-Outliers.ipynb`
- `5-Cleansing.ipynb`

The `Normal Distribuion Notebook.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook contains the my work exploring the Normal Distribuion. 

The repository also contains a `Content` folder. This holds images and data used in the Jupyter Notebooks. 

# Intructions to Reader

To download and run my Jupyter Notebooks on your local machine: 

To do:
1. Go to my repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/ShaneOG2/fund-data-analysis-assessment).
2. Click on the green `<> Code` button and `Download Zip`.
3. Save folder to your local machine. 
4. Navigate to where you have save the `Practicals` on your machine using your command line. 
5. Type `jupyter notebook` - this will open and run Jupyter Notebooks in your browser. From there you will be able to run each of the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository. 

# Python Libraries

At the start of each Jupyter Notebook I have outlined which libraries I am using. Below is a brief description of each library. 

- `urllib.request` is a library for opening URLs. 
- `random` is used to generate random numbers.
- `math` module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.
- `numpy` is a library used for working with arrays. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` - is used for customised data visualisations. 
- `seaborn`- uses matplotlib and is also used for data visualisations. 
- `pandas` - data analysis and manipulation tool. 
- `re` - provides regular expression support in Python. 
- `scipy.stats` - provides access to statistical functions.  
- `itertools` - used to iterate over data structures that can be stepped over using a for-loop.
