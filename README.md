# Fundamentals of Data Analysis

This repository contains my work for the Fundamentals of 
Data Analysis Module at ATU as part of the Higher Diploma 
in Computing (Data Analytics). 

# Overview

This repository contains a `Practicals` folder which has two parts:

1. `Regular Tasks`
2. `Normal Distribuion Notebook.ipynb`

The `Regular Tasks` contains 5 Jupyter Notebooks, each containing exercises from each topic we explored over the course of the module. 

- `1-Information.ipynb`
- `2-Randomness.ipynb`
- `3-Bias.ipynb`
- `4-Outliers.ipynb`
- `5-Cleansing.ipynb`

The `Normal Distribuion Notebook.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook contains the my work exploring the Normal Distribuion.
